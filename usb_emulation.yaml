# This will be for setting up a Raspberry Pi with USB-Gadget-Mode to work as a emulated USB flash drive.

# Create a directory to store files
# SCP files to it
# Take these files, create a FAT32 ISO image to present over gadget-mode
# Present it, read-only
#
# Have a watchdog script which monitors for changes
# If changes found, "detach" the virtual drive.
# Create a new ISO
# Wait a few seconds if needed
# Present the new ISO over USB
#
# TODO: Decide what is done by script, what is done by Ansible, what is local, what is remote, should the repo be on the fileserver, etc?
