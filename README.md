# HomeAnsible
In my quest to showcase some of my personal code, this is where I will share my personal Ansible playbooks for building/maintaining my home systems. I am sharing them for educational purposes and to showcase my code publicly. Everything is customized for my environment, so it likely will need heavy modification for use anywhere else, but if you find use in it, great.

This is not a complete set. I am adding pieces one-by-one after checking for/sanitizing any sensitive information.
